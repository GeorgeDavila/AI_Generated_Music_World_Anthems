# AI_Generated_Music_World_Anthems
Using AI to generate novel music. Use national anthems as training data aiming for a sort of AI-generated World Anthem.

### Training Data
Downloaded national anthems from sites listed below. Anthems are public domain, so good to use as training data. Use two main audio file types: MP3 and MIDI.

MP3s are higher-fidelity but bit harder to work with for our purposes. 

MIDIs play the notes of songs using an electric piano type sound. Plays just major notes, whereas in real music/sound there are obviously plenty of subtle frequency transitions. But their relative simplicity makes it a bit easier for our AI to work with them, expect a more intelligible output for this reason. We 

#### MP3 format 
MP3 Anthems sourced from http://anthemworld.com required manual download so only picked a few, mainly larger population, nations. More training data the better, please feel free to let me know if you have all of them in mp3 format, will credit accordingly.  

#### MIDI format
Sourced from http://www.midiworld.com/search/5/?q=national%20anthems Which has 136 anthems listed, so about 60 nations are still missing from this set. Easier to download from here but still had to do it manually, so please let me know if I missed anything. Careful if you use it yourself, some of the last ones are 

### Misc
There are philharmonic albums of their  renditions of the anthems and things like that. I don't use those here because 1) costs money 2) may not classify as public domain same way regular anthems do and 3) the AI may pick some of the style of the philharmonic, not capturing as much uniqueness of each anthem and making the AI a bit less robust.
